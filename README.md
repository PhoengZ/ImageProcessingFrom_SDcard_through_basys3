# Project Readme  
Since I did not write all the code by myself, there are several sections that I need to understand on my own.

## Steps to read data from the SD Card:  
2.Convert the GIF file into 6 PNG frames, each frame being RGB16bit, 64x48.
3.Convert each PNG into a .bin file.
4.Combine the 6 .bin files into a single .bin file.
5.Write the generated .bin file to the SD card.

Feel free to explore the project and modify it as needed. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
